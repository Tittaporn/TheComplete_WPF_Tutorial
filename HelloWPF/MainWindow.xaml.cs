            // Ad-hoc formatting ==> If you only need to apply formatting for a specific piece of information, e.g. the contents of a single Label control, you can easily do this, on-the-fly, using a combination of the ToString() method and the CultureInfo class. For instance, in the example above, I applied different, culture-based formatting like this:
            double largeNumber = 123456789.42;
            CultureInfo usCulture = new CultureInfo("en-US");
            CultureInfo deCulture = new CultureInfo("de-DE");
            CultureInfo seCulture = new CultureInfo("sv-SE");
            lbResult.Items.Add("\n");
            lbResult.Items.Add("Large Number With Culture / UICulture :" + largeNumber);
            lbResult.Items.Add("English(US) : " + largeNumber.ToString("N2", usCulture));
            lbResult.Items.Add("German(DE) : " + largeNumber.ToString("N2", deCulture));
            lbResult.Items.Add("Swedish(SE) : " + largeNumber.ToString("N2", seCulture));
            
            // Handling exceptions in WPF ==> In this case, the user would be forced to close your application, due to such a simple and easily avoided error. So, if you know that things might go wrong, then you should use a try-catch block, like this:
            string s = null;
            try
            {
                s.Trim();
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                MessageBox.Show("A handled exception just occurred: " + ex.Message, "Exception Sample", MessageBoxButton.OK, MessageBoxImage.Error);
            }
        }

        private void HandelingExceptionButton_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
        {
            string s = null;
            try
            {
                s.Trim();
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                MessageBox.Show("A handled exception just occurred from using try and catch exception : " + ex.Message, "Try Catch Exception Sample", MessageBoxButton.OK, MessageBoxImage.Warning);
            }
            // Notice that I call the Trim() method an extra time, outside of the try-catch block, so that the first call is handled, while the second is not. For the second one, we need the App.xaml magic ==> DispatcherUnhandledException="Application_DispatcherUnhandledException" :
            s.Trim();
        }

        private void CultureInfoSwitchButton_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
        {
            // Dealing with the culture of your WPF application is very important, but fortunately for you, WPF will do a lot of it for you completely out-of-the-box. If you need to change the default behavior, it's quite easy as well, using the CurrentCulture and CurrentUICulture properties, as illustrated in the numerous examples of this article. The interesting part is found in the CultureInfoSwitchButton_Click event, where we set CurrentCulture based on which of the buttons were clicked, and then update the two labels containing a number and a date:
            Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture = new CultureInfo((sender as Button).Tag.ToString());
            lblNumber.Content = (123456789.42d).ToString("N2");
            lblDate.Content = DateTime.Now.ToString();
        }
    }
}

/* Important Window properties
The WPF Window class has a bunch of interesting attributes that you may set to control the look and behavior of your application window. Here's a short list of the most interesting ones:

Icon - Allows you to define the icon of the window, which is usually shown in the upper left corner, to the left of the window title.

ResizeMode - This controls whether and how the end-user can resize your window. The default is CanResize, which allows the user to resize the window like any other window, either by using the maximize/minimize buttons or by dragging one of the edges. CanMinimize will allow the user to minimize the window, but not to maximize it or drag it bigger or smaller. NoResize is the strictest one, where the maximize and minimize buttons are removed and the window can't be dragged bigger or smaller.

ShowInTaskbar - The default is true, but if you set it to false, your window won't be represented in the Windows taskbar. Useful for non-primary windows or for applications that should minimize to the tray.

SizeToContent - Decide if the Window should resize itself to automatically fit its content. The default is Manual, which means that the window doesn't automatically resize. Other options are Width, Height and WidthAndHeight, and each of them will automatically adjust the window size horizontally, vertically or both.

Topmost - The default is false, but if set to true, your Window will stay on top of other windows unless minimized. Only useful for special situations.

WindowStartupLocation - Controls the initial position of your window. The default is Manual, which means that the window will be initially positioned according to the Top and Left properties of your window. Other options are CenterOwner, which will position the window in the center of it's owner window, and CenterScreen, which will position the window in the center of the screen.

WindowState - Controls the initial window state. It can be either Normal, Maximized or Minimized. The default is Normal, which is what you should use unless you want your window to start either maximized or minimized.
